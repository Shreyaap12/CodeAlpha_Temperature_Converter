# CodeAlpha_Temperature_Converter
A temperature converter helps in the conversion of the measurement units of the temperature recorded in a particular unit. Temperature expresses the degree of heat or cold of a solid, liquid, or gas. While Kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature, people generally use Centigrade or Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to measure temperature.
